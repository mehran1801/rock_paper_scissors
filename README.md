# rock_paper_scissors-game
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

    Rock destroys scissors.
    Scissors cut paper.
    Paper covers rock.
    If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:

    Get the user’s choice.
    Get the computer’s choice.
    Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
    Start the program and display the results.
